## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Structuring a program using functions (Procedural Programming)
- Separating logic, data, and display layers
- Using `enum` and `struct` as data models
- Passing data between functions cleanly
- Random number generation with `rand()` and `srand()`

## 🕹️ How to Play

1. Run the program
2. Choose how many rounds (1 to 10)
3. Enter your choice:
   - `1` = Stone
   - `2` = Paper
   - `3` = Scissors
4. The computer picks randomly
5. Best of N rounds wins!

> 🟢 Screen turns **green** if you win  
> 🔴 Screen turns **red** if you lose  
> 🟡 Screen turns **yellow** on a draw

## 💡 Key Concepts

| Concept                  | Where in Code                                   |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Enums as named constants | `enGameChoice`, `enWinner`                      |
| Structs as data models   | `stRoundInfo`, `stGameResults`                  |
| Pure logic functions     | `WhoWonTheRound()`, `RandomNumber()`            |
| Display functions        | `PrintRoundResults()`, `ShowFinalGameResults()` |
| Game loop                | `StartGame()`, `PlayGame()`                     |
